## Keyboard Shortcuts & Navigation

The Page Navigation Component provides full keyboard accessibility with comprehensive shortcuts for all operations. This ensures the application is usable by everyone, including users who rely on assistive technologies or prefer keyboard navigation.

### Navigation

- **Tab** - Move forward through focusable elements
- **Shift+Tab** - Move backward through focusable elements

### Page Tab Actions

When a page tab is focused (requires 2 Tab presses - first focuses container, second focuses the tab):

- **Enter** or **Space** - Select/activate the focused page
- **Delete** (Mac delete key) - Delete the focused page
- **F2** - Rename the focused page

### Context Menu

- **Escape** - Close context menu when open

### Rename Dialog

- **Enter** - Confirm rename operation
- **Escape** - Cancel rename operation

### How to Use Keyboard Navigation

1. **Tab** twice to focus on a page tab
   - First Tab press focuses the navigation container
   - Second Tab press focuses the actual page tab
2. **Enter** or **Space** to select the page
3. **Delete** to delete the page
4. **F2** to rename the page
5. **Shift+Tab** to go back in the focus order

### Notes for macOS Users

On macOS, the keyboard behavior follows standard conventions:

- The **Delete** key on MacBook keyboards functions as **Backspace** in most contexts
- **Fn+Delete** sends the actual **Delete** keycode
- The application handles both **Delete** and **Backspace** keys for page deletion
- **Tab** navigation requires two presses to focus page tabs (standard web behavior)

This keyboard navigation system ensures the application is fully accessible and provides a smooth experience for all users, regardless of their preferred input method.
